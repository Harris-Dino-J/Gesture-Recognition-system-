Gesture Recognition System

Overview

The Gesture Recognition System is a machine learning/computer vision-based project that detects and interprets human hand gestures. It can be used in applications such as human-computer interaction, sign language translation, touchless control systems, and more.

Features

Real-time gesture detection using webcam or video input

Supports a predefined set of hand gestures

Uses machine learning / deep learning / OpenCV for recognition

Easily extendable for custom gestures

Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/Mac)


Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, MediaPipe, TensorFlow/Keras or Scikit-learn (based on implementation)

Optional Hardware: Webcam / External camera

Models: Pretrained or custom-trained CNN / ML models


Installation

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gesture-recognition-system.git
cd gesture-recognition-system
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

python gesture_recognition.py

Show your hand to the camera.

The system will display or log the recognized gesture.


Supported Gestures

Open palm

Fist

Thumbs up

Thumbs down

Victory sign (✌)

"Stop" gesture
(Add or change depending on your dataset)

Dataset

The model is trained using the [Your Dataset Name] or a custom-collected dataset of hand gesture images. You can replace it with your own dataset following the given format.

Future Enhancements

Add support for dynamic gestures (e.g., waving)

Improve accuracy in low-light conditions

Integrate with external systems (e.g., smart home, robotics)
